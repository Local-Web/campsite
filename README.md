# Campsite

A proof-of-concept implementation of a server embodying values of the [Local Web](docs/local-web.md).

## Getting Started

This server is a work in progress at the moment. An ideal implementation of this server would use WebRTC for maximum decentralization. However, this would at a minimum require a signaling server, which would significantly complicate the implementation here.

For now, you should be able to run this as-is locally or on a service such as Heroku.
